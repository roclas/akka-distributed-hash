<h2>a distributed hash in a cluster in akka</h2>

<p>
How it works:
</p>

<p>
1- start the first node of the cluster (on port 2551): sbt "run 2551"   
</p>
<p>
2- check the hash on the fist node through an http GET request: curl http://localhost:8551<br/>
    (you'll see nothing; the hash is empty)
</p>

<p>
3- put elements into the hash through an http PUT request: curl -X PUT http://localhost:8551 --data "hello=123&world=456"<br/>
    (this will insert some more data in that node's hash)
</p>

<p>
4- check the hash again now: curl http://localhost:8551
</p>

</p>
5- start the second node of the cluster (on port 2552): sbt "run 2552"
</p>

<p>
6- check that the hash has been copied to the second (actually to all) node(s) of the cluster: <br/>
	curl http://localhost:8552/hello<br/>
	curl http://localhost:8552/world<br/>
	or simply<br/>
	curl http://localhost:8552
</p>
	

<p>
AND YOU ARE DONE!!
</p>

<p>
*** http deletes (Eg: " curl -X DELETE http://localhost:8551 --data 'hello' ") are supported<br/>
*** try now to delete something from one of the nodes and check that it's been deleted in the other nodes<br/>
</p>
